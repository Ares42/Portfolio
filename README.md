# Luke Solomon's Official Portfolio

<br>

**What am I looking at?**

This is my official iOS app portfolio. Below I explain a lot of my reasoning behind building this weird project, but this stands as a dumping ground for my "trick shots," things I did in Swift that would otherwise have made me say, "Xbox, record that." For example, the first time I was able to integrate localAuth (TouchID, FaceID, etc) into an app, I decided to save that code into this repository in case I ever wanted to look at it again.

It doesn't contain every project that I'm proud of, but it certainly exemplifies a lot of my talents. If you build and compile this app, you'll be presented with a collection view that links you directly to each of my projects. As of now, it contains these "Sub-projects":

Lukestagram:
A fully functional Instagram Clone, using Firebase as a backend. Check this out.

LocalAuth:
A functioning LocalAuth check. Uses FaceID or TouchID if available.

Sorting:
A simple screen displaying some sorting algorithms I've built in Swift.

Data Structures:
A simple program I wrote to check to see if an array of numbers is a palindrome, using a linked list.

MapView:
A simple example of a map view App.

**Under Construction:**

Steam:
Once I learn how to work with OAuth, this will be something cool. See below for more information.

HackerRank Mobile:
My plan was to construct a mobile version of HackerRank. Their API Turned out to be very tough to work with.

Jet Lag Calculator:
I had a really cool plan for this - I wanted to be able to take in your flight information and give you information on when to sleep. Turned out to be a lot more calculations than I was ready to take on.

## Why this project?

As you can clearly see from my GitHub page, I've started and abandoned my fair share of projects. Especially with the advent of Swift 3 and the slow yet steady march of deprication, maintaining old code in iOS is a nightmare.
To solve this, I've decided to create a massive XCode project that serves several purposes:

* Shows off what I'm capable of to future employers.
* Lets me test cool new frameworks in a safe environment.
* Serves as a repository for those moments of, "How did I get that thing working?"
* Is something that I enjoy working on and would use myself.

<br>

## Why is it called HackerRankMobile?

That's really just what the repo was titled originally - creating a mobile HackerRank app is on of the many ideas I have for this portfolio. I also really don't want to go through the effort of changing the repo's name right now.

<br>

## What have you been working on lately?

The Steam App turned out to require a lot of knowledge of OAuth, so I decided to go a different route and learn how to work with Firebase by building an instagram clone. It's now finished, so I've moved on to some new personal projects.

<br>

## Where did the inspiration for these projects come from?

As of this writing, the Steam iOS app is pretty awful. While it does allow you to do the ever important two-factor authentication, the app is basically just a hamburger menu that displays a webview of the Steam mobile site.

### Which brings up some very important things you should know about me.

* I hate hamburger menus.
* I hate mobile sites.
* I hate bad apps.

<br>

Negativity aside, I absolutely love Steam. I've had a Steam account for almost 15 years, and I have over 300 games. Gaming has always been one of my passions, and seeing such a poorly put together app from a company I love just makes me sad.

<br>

### So their app sucks. What do you hope to do with yours?
 
Well, originally my idea was to create a mobile app for the website TrueSteamAchievements, but because I'm not willing to hack their API just yet, I decided to pursue something with an open API. Basically, all I'm planning to do right now is to create an app that shows some cool statistics about a person's Steam profile, their achievements, and their recent playtime. Because I'm not totally sure about what their API will allow me to do, I'm keeping the scope fairly modest at the moment. Let it be know though that I have plans in the future to have this showcase more than just some Steam stats, which is why the current architecture is so weird.
