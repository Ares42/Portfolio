# Luke Solomon's Official Portfolio Project

<br>

# To Do:

* Integrate Steam OAuth
* Integrate iOS Charts API

<br>

## Why this project?

As you can clearly see from my GitHub page, I've started and abandoned my fair share of projects. Especially with the advent of Swift 3 and the slow yet steady march of deprication, maintaining old code in iOS is a nightmare.
To solve this, I've decided to create a massive XCode project that serves several purposes:

* Shows off what I'm capable of to future employers.
* Lets me test cool new frameworks in a safe environment.
* Serves as a repository for those moments of, "How did I get that thing working?"
* Is something that I enjoy working on and would use myself.

<br>

## Why is it called HackerRankMobile?

That's really just what the repo was titled originally - creating a mobile HackerRank app is on of the many ideas I have for this portfolio. I also really don't want to go through the effort of changing the repo's name right now.

<br>

## What have you been working on lately?

The Steam App turned out to require a lot of knowledge of OAuth, so I decided to go a different route and learn how to work with Firebase by building an instagram clone.

<br>

## Where did the inspiration for these projects come from?

As of this writing, the Steam iOS app is pretty awful. While it does allow you to do the ever important two-factor authentication, the app is basically just a hamburger menu that displays a webview of the Steam mobile site.

<br>

As for the instagram clone, it's a pretty common example of an app that should be replicated in order to help a person understand the quirks of iOS and how a backend should function. 

<br>

### Which brings up some very important things you should know about me.

* I hate hamburger menus.
* I hate mobile sites.
* I hate bad apps.

<br>

Negativity aside, I absolutely love Steam. I've had a Steam account for almost 15 years, and I have over 300 games. Gaming has always been one of my passions, and seeing such a poorly put together app from a company I love just makes me sad.

<br>

## So their app sucks. What do you hope to do with yours?

Well, originally my idea was to create a mobile app for the website TrueSteamAchievements, but because I'm not willing to hack their API just yet, I decided to pursue something with an open API. Basically, all I'm planning to do right now is to create an app that shows some cool statistics about a person's Steam profile, their achievements, and their recent playtime. Because I'm not totally sure about what their API will allow me to do, I'm keeping the scope fairly modest at the moment. Let it be know though that I have plans in the future to have this showcase more than just some Steam stats, which is why the current architecture is so weird.
